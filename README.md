# My Personal Website

This is the code repository for my personal website. It uses the *Minimal Mistakes*
GitHub pages theme and is served as a static markdown driven website. Making new 
posts is easy:

1. Create a post as `YYYY-MM-DD-post-title.md` in `_posts`
2. Write the post and use assets in `assets/` if needed (e.g., images)
3. Push to the repository!

Thats all!
