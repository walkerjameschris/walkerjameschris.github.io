Hey, I'm Chris Walker! I'm a seasoned Senior Data Scientist with a passion
for using data to solve complex problems. My journey in analytics began at
Texas A&M University, where I earned a BS in Urban and Regional Planning
with a minor in Economics. I was an undergraduate research scholar where
I forecasts home values after Hurricane Florence. I later pursued a Master
of Science in Analytics from the Georgia Institute of Technology, where
I delved into modeling, simulation, and machine learning methods.

I've spent a significant portion of my career at Fannie Mae, where I've
contributed to the development and maintenance of credit risk models used
in their mortgage underwriting engine, Desktop Underwriter. These models
play a crucial role in determining the approval of millions of mortgage
applications each year. My work regularly involves a variety of modeling
approaches, including linear, logistic, and tree-based methods. Beyond
my core responsibilities, I've taken on a leadership role in an internal
continuing education program, where I guide course development on
programming, statistics, data visualization, and language model applications.

In my free time, you can find me enjoying the peacefulness of the Maryland woods
or serving at my church.
